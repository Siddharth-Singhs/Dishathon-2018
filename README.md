# Dishathon-2018
-  **What it does:** <br>Inspiration
This year during the Google KeyNote IO 2017,<br>
The story of Tania was shown and how google made products for specially abled people and used Morse Code to help them in engaging in everyday activities.<br>
This inspired us to make a product for such special people so that the power of morse code can be used to change channels on a television.<br>

-  **What it does:** <br>
This product converts eye blinks into morse code and then changes channels according to the pattern entered.<br>

-  **How we built it:** <br> 
We used Google Vision to recognize the eyes of the person.Then depending on the pattern of the blinks, <br>
The morse code is converted into a number and then this is used to change the channel.<br>

-  **Challenges we ran into:** <br> 
The biggest challenge which came was the proper identification of eye blinks.



-  **Built With:** <br>
android <br>
google-vision <br>
python <br>
javascript <br>
java <br>
